% If you can travel from place A to place B by some T then you can do vice versa and
% travel from B to A by the same means. Hence we need to make our graph an undirected graph.
%
% directly_connected(?First, ?Second, ?T) holds iff it is possible to travel from a
% place 'First' to a place 'Second' by 'T' and vise versa.
